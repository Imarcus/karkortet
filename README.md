This is an android application for members of the Chalmers University of Technology Student Union.
The purpose of this application is to provide Chalmers students at both Johanneberg and Lindholmen campus an easy way to look up what the restaurants on these campuses are serving and how much money they have on their Student Union cards.

The menus from which this application gathers its data comes from these rss-feeds: http://www.chalmerskonferens.se/en/rss-2/
